** Overview

access all system data from a single resource
collects metrics, logs,, etc

Most AWS systems automatically publish detailed 1 minute metrics

Cloudwatch Agent (part of AWS Systems Manager) or API can be used
to collect, publish, and store this data

Can be used to scale up and scale down to improve resource allocation

Can also be used for
- Application Monitoring 
- collect info from application logs, etc (store out of product)
cloudwatch alarm triggers SNS function
triggers lambda which runs on database
application stock levels modified and updated

Log Analysis

** Features
*** Collection
 Logs - vended (VPC Flow, S3 bucket), Services (EC2, Cloudsearch, etc), Custom logs using AWS System Manager to install an agent
 Metrics - collect default metrics from 70 services
 CloutTrail Logs

*** Monitoring
 Unified Dashboards
 High resolution Alarms

*** Act
 Automated Response to CloudWatch Events
 ASG Scale Events
 Notify SNS or Run a Lambda

*** Security
 PCI and FedRamp Compliant
 Encrytped at rest and in transit

 Metrics

 how to implement
 what can it do
 do I have to do anything else
 how long is it available
 do I have to do somethig to store it
 what can I do with the data


 Cloud Trail
 costs
 what the hell is it
 do I have to do anythig

** Pricing
* CloudTrail
** Links
** Overview
** Features
** Pricing

** compliance
provides a history of activity on the AWS account

** data Exfiltration
detect output through object level API events

integrates with cloudwatch
records management console and API calls - along with source IP and time
can define workflows for when security violations occur

** Best Practices


it is always on - 90 days available 
can be configured to write logs to s3 bucket




can hook up object data event for imports S3 - only access by ec2

IAM changes


So, send logs to S3
send logs also to CloudWatch
Add ararm


Free to view, filter and download management events for 90 days
Single copy of management events shipped to S3 is free other than S3 charges
Data Events are $0.10 per 100,000

So, need to estimate number of management and data events


* Set up for Security

- Enable CloudTrail: kineticcommerce-cloudtrail
- All regions
- 



* Terraform

- can set up cloud trails
- can set up metrics alarms





MVP
create the main cloudtrail bucket
create the main cloud trail for all regions
hook up data events for Kielhs and l'oreal buckets
hook up management events for everything


Alarming!
what kind of alarm could I set for security?

More more
Question: Can and should they be separated? A separate trail for Kiehls etc.
Which should I add to terraform?
Probabably data events that are associated with the S3 buckets created




set up a slack channel for updates - aws-alerts
- changes to cloudtrail configuration
- insecure cloudtrail buckets



Cloud trail already on in dev! W00!
