:postgresql:schema:sql:snippet:

== Overview ==

A schema is a namespace. It can contain named db objects such as:

- views
- tables
- data types
- indexes
- operators
- functions

== Reasons for Use ==

- As wih all namespaces, allow multiple people to access without trampling all over each other
- Easier to manage with logically grouped objects

= Using Shcemata =

== Listing Schemata ==

To list schemas in the database:

select schema_name from information_schema.schemata;

== Selecting Schema ==

select current_schema();
select * from staff; -- uses the path order - usually $user, public
select * from sales.staff; -- explicit call to schema

== Modifying Schemata ==

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS sales; -- creates a schema
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS sales; -- like it says on the tin
ALTER SCHEMA; -- go read the docs for this one
