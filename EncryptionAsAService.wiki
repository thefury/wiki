- Intro
  - I'm looking into methods for de-coupling encryption from the database
  - reason for wanting to do this
    - database level encryption makes key rotation and management non-trivial
    - could use something like pg-crypto
    - multiple persistent stores could use different engines and keys
  - this ariticle is my learning on the subject

- One of the standout products in secrets management is Vault
  - the more I play with it, the happier I am with it
  - I'm continuing to experiment with combining it with Consul

- Encryption as a Service or The Transit Secret Engine
  - after adding the transit secret backend
  - the application encrypts the data in memory using the RESTful endpoint
  - the application writes the encrypted data to the persistent store
  - decryption is the reverse

- Decryption is the reverse

- problems with this methid
  - querying is impossible, wheras with pgcrypto you can put decrypt into the query
  - show an example of this
  - however, I think this would be pretty damn slow to begin with
  - should do a quick test
- Rotation of Keys
  - link to a new aritcle on rotating transit keys in vault, especially in respect to pg
  - This is critically important for me
  - why is rotation, especially simple roation, important to me
  - doing things repeatedly and automating them is amazing
