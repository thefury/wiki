# Workyard Infrastructure Ideas

:workyard:cleanup:business:ideas:

There are systems that I see people asking for. I would sell them access to my scripts, or I
would sell them maintenance time as well as a small retainer.


These will be built with best practices, etc.
All can be made with development, staging, production (or multiple production)
All work with containerized workloads

Simple API
Simple web app with frontend
A corporate blogging site
A corporate sales site
A cross region redundant API
A turnkey CI/CD, git, toolchain
A k8s system in AKS
A nomad system in AWS
logging and monitoring of a system
alerting through victorops, etc.
a caching layer for memory
a persistence layer - containerized for dev
a persistence layer - managed for prod


What I offer:

- installation of the system requested with given parameters
- ongoing maintenance retainer
- documentation on how this works

Additional

- modifications of an existing product
- training online
- training in person
- on-call support
