== Overview ==

A view is a named query. It dose not store data, except in the case of a materialized view, except in the case of a `materialized view`.

== Reasons for Use ==

- useful in encapsulating a complex query
- a `materialized view` stores (and periodically refreshes) data, leading to faster access, caching, etc.

== Listing Views ==

From `psql`: `\dv *.*`, or `\dv bigquery.*`

In SQL:

SELECT table_name from information_schema.views where table_schema = 'bigquery';
