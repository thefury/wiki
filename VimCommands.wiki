## Leader Key

You often see things like <leader>ww in vim commands. This is a special key that allows the user to create customizable commands.

### Modifying

To change from the default ('\') to a comma, put this in your vimrc file:

`let mapeader = ","`

### Custom Commands

To create a custom, easier to use, command that calls `:bufdo e!`:

`map <leader>e :bufdo e!<CR>`
